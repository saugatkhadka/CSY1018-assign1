				<h1>about me | who is <span class="doge">@captaindoge</span>?</h1>
				<span class="textface">¯\_(ツ)_/¯</span> 
				<h2>Student, a slacker <span class="textface">ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ</span> , inventor, thinker and a web developer</h2>

				<p>Saugat breaks and replaces things really often. Like his operating system every few weeks, all the data on his hard drive every few months <span class="textface">ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)</span>  , and somethings that even he cannot fathom. What did he break this week? But, it's what makes him, him. </p>

				<p>Thankfully he loves anime, and that solves most of his problem mysteriously. He waits until last minutes to do most of the things but somehow he learns a lot from those experiences. Like the importance of time management as a student and a volunteer. And did I mention, an avid anime enthusiast who dreams of a future like SAO but without all the killing and probably like the second season and the movie coming after it. </p>

				<p>Everyday he wonders if it is possible that we are living in a simulation and tries to find access into the root. But alas, he has not come very far but it looks possible. </p>

				<p>Beside thinking about possibilties and between anime seasons, he can be found at his desk any time of the day, 7 days a week, 365 all year around. Why? Who knows? For heaven's sake, the man barely is seen sleeping and looks like he has just woken up anytime you meet him. Just why? He say, "Because Rick and Morty Season 3 is up <span class="textface">(づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ</span>" . Yes he made that face.</p>

				<p>If he is not doing anything else, he is listening to music on youtube. Yeah, it only remains fun until you listen to it online. Once it goes offline, you'll never find it again, neither will you search for it. His words, not mine. The electrical outage makes him grumpy <span class="textface">(ノಠ益ಠ)ノ彡┻━┻</span>  . It's hard to deal with him then.</p>

				<p>But above all else, whatever he may seem, he is a passionate guy. He loves what he loves and what he doesn't he try to understand. He believes the world can go on but people need to change. He believes more on the future generation, though he is just young lad. He loves to talk about education and how new forms of technologies can facilitate a better form of education as well. The world is a good place, he wants to leave it a good place for the generation to come. And he will do his best with all the junk food buying frenzy to stop young ones from eating them.</p>

				<p>Let's aid the world to become a more livable place with technology, not replace everything including us. </p>

				<h2>So Who I am?</h2>
				<p>NAMI & University of Northampton 1st year student</p>
				<p>A budding Front End Web Developer</p>
				<p>Open Education Advocate</p>
