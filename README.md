Portfolio
===========

Throughout the process of coding up this portfolio page, my design did not change very much. Card UI and box shadow was an unexpected addition to the whole portfolio. The first design was a pretty plain and just structure to help facilitate the design process and get a good picture of what the web page should look like. I had a good idea of how I wanted my page to look. Really slimmed down and very basic with pleasing aesthetics. So I decided to choose clean white and greyish theme for the whole page and dark image for the navigation pane. 
Though it is recommended that websites be done mobile first, I made the desktop version first and scaled everything down to fit all screen sizes down to iPhone 4.  During the period of the assignment, I went through various portfolios and many designs on the internet. codepen and fresh website design is two places I mostly visited to get ideas for my designs.  Most of the design made, were made with the use of Javascript frameworks and bootstrap. Creating similar designs in pure CSS was a fun and informative experience. I had to go through some tutorials to get a good grasp of box model and positioning. In the end, I made very little sketches and wireframes that I expected. The ones I made are listed below.


Sketches
-----------
I made a very small sketch for just the basic of the page and which will be followed throughout the development process. Font sizes for different and basic components for all pages are also written down. Mentioned font size are the latest trend in the blogging community and also medium uses them and they have really good readability. And colors theme for the overall page is also set down. I mainly wet with flat colors because they are easy on the eyes and catchy at the same time.

After going through some portfolio design and vcards on the web, I decided to settle for a simple design and stick to the common template. I made the following wireframes based on the conclusion. The first wireframe I made was the final and decisive design I settled on. 
Pros: Clean looking design and simple codes required
Cons: Not enough punch and visual appeal, Has very little content and animation

Wireframes

###1.	Home Page
 
 
 
###2.	Bio/ About me Page

###4.	Contact me page
 
 
Mobile view
-----------------
Since I made the page responsive for mobile last, it was quite a hurdle to get everything to work properly. I used the viewport to get the site to scale and made some adjustments to the containers. I only made the wireframe after getting the site to be responsive on phones and used media queries to display the content properly. Little change were made to the mobile view after making the wireframe. So the portfolio is consistent with the wireframe.

Pictures of the first design
------------------------------
I started with a basic structure of the page and build it with black and white accent.  I really wanted to use the card UI, so I used it to display the CV page contents. 


1.	Home Page
 
2.	Bio

3.	CV
 
4.	Contact

After the first try at the website, I realized that I was missing some photos (fixed soon after) and footer was not fixed to the bottom of the page. From looking it up, it was due to less content or bad responsive configuration. I tried to solve but there were most suggestion for using javascript, so I chose to increase the amount of content in every page so even high definition screen would not reach the end without a scroll.  After that solved my problem, there were cases were some online responsive test sent back unresponsive navbar. As far as I’ve tried it worked with all my devices so, I decided to leave it just as it is.

Good practice
--------------
To my best extent, I tried to keep to a good and respected design language as much as possible. Google’s material design was a worthwhile read and implementation was simple. But after completing most of my page, I found that textarea element was not working properly or rather doing some random animations or transitions in my browser using live server. But it worked well in other devices and in  webpage test, it had good scores and there were no critical validation errors on any validators. After sending it to review to our module tutor, I finalized my designs and code, formatted everything according to the guidelines and prepared for submission.
